        <h5>Your Privacy </h5>
        <p>At LearnTorah.com, respecting the privacy and security of your personal information is important to us. We know, however, that not everyone who takes their privacy seriously is necessarily well-versed in "legal or regulatory-ese." There are plenty of legal terms in LearnTorah.comâ€™s own privacy policy, which you will find on the following pages. We urge you to read it carefully, and make note of your rights under this policy. We've tried to provide easy-to-understand explanations of the most frequently used legal terms -- terms we are required to use to ensure clarity and consistency. We want to make sure that your personal information is protected, and that you understand the policies that protect you. You'll find the same terms used in many companies' privacy policies. </p>
