			<h5>Parashat Vayakhel: The Merit of the Righteous Women <i id="weekly-play" class="ico-play-yellow"></i> <i id="weekly-print" class="ico-print-yellow"></i></h5>
			
			<p>We read in Parashat Vayakhel of Beneh Yisrael’s generous and enthusiastic response to Moshe’s call for donations of materials for the construction of the Mishkan.
